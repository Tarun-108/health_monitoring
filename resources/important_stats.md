Worked with [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) to design and simulate.

# Hardware

## Temperature Sensor
[DS18B20](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ds18b20.html): Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer
- DS18B20 was chosen over LM35 as we need a digital sensor.
- I learned that this is a programmable sensor with an alarm range that can be set.
